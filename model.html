        <h2 id="overview">Project Function</h2>
        <p>
            This project has been a learning experience for both of the authors. AI is a word that one cannot seem to
            escape, nor can one seem to escape the promises that it will change the world in a net positive way. We have
            doubts about that, but Dr. Joy Buolawmini’s book “Unmasking AI” gave us a lot to reflect on and left us
            feeling optimistic that the world imagined by the oft reported on tech leaders is not inevitable.
        </p>
        <P>
            While there is much technical work that went into this project, and Dr. Joy is very much a technical expert,
            it was her journey from academic to organizer that has been so resonant throughout this assignment.Both the
            authors of this website are history undergraduates and neither works with computers in the highly technical
            way a computer scientist or full stack developer might, so to see how Dr. Joy’s work was more humanitarian
            and less technical was inspiring to us. Often it seems that one needs a deep understanding of something
            technical before they can bring something into the discussion, but Dr. Joy’s most impactful work was done
            through art and organizing. It was especially gratifying to see how, even in uncertainty, her commitment to
            giving the unseen and unheard a voice was a constant.
        </P>
        <p>
            Another piece that was resonant as we worked on this project was around how much of our surroundings we just
            accept. As Dr. Joy went through the history of technological developments like the camera and up into computer
            vision, it was easy to imagine a world that looked entirely different. One that included the views of the
            underrepresented and historically marginalized, one that valued human endeavours over profit. As she states
            “The work towards algorithmic justice must not be just international; it must also be intergenerational.”
            This project made us think deeply about how AI was presented to us day to day, how its use was portrayed,
            and what we were implicitly saying with all of the language and images used in our project.

        <p>
            Why did we choose this project? What is the importance? What impact did Dr. Buolawmini's journey have on our own project?
        </p>

    <div>
        <h2 id="scope">Scope of Work</h2>
        <p>
            What was and what wasn't considered during the project?

        <h2 id="process">The Process</h2>
        <p>
            How was the model created? Attribute where the data came from include link to the github repository.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
           How have perspectives changed since having had the experience of labeling data and training a model?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 id="demo">The Model in Action</h2>
        <p>
            Have video of model in action
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2 id="our-model">Get the Code!</h2>
        <p>
            Link out to the github repo again
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also try the model in real time. Because it utilizes a webcam we have placed on a different page so
            that visitors are not immediately asked to turn their camera on. Use the link below!
