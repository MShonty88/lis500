        <p>Leopold Green is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University. Dr. Green earned his Bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Hampton University, and then went on to pursue his doctoral studies at the University of California, Riverside. Professor Green’s work focuses on creating biological therapeutics to treat chronic illnesses. To do this, Dr. Green uses synthetic DNA to create tudes, which can be put into cells and allow proteins or other chemicals to pass through. This can dramatically alter how the cells work. This approach can be used, Dr. Green hopes, to treat chronic illnesses. He states that this work is a “beautiful balance of art and science and engineering.”</p>
