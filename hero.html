        Leopold Green is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University. Dr. Green earned his
        Bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Hampton University, and then went on to pursue his doctoral studies at
        the University of California, Riverside. Professor Green’s work focuses on creating biological therapeutics
        to treat chronic illnesses. To do this, Dr. Green uses synthetic DNA to create tudes, which can be put into
        cells and allow proteins or other chemicals to pass through. This can dramatically alter how the cells work.
        This approach can be used, Dr. Green hopes, to treat chronic illnesses. He states that this work is a
        “beautiful balance of art and science and engineering.”

        We chose Dr. Green as our tech hero because his work intersects with our own lives in different ways. Mike
        has worked in a healthcare adjacent field for over 10 years, and was diagnosed with glaucoma at the age of 16.
        Dr. Green's work appealed to Sam because she has dealt with chronic illness in her life, and has been
        fascinated with new ways to treat various illnesses.
